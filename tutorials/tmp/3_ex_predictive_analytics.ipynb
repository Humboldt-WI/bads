    "# BADS Exercise 3 on the foundations of predictive analytics\n",
    "The following exercise tasks revisit some concepts covered in [Tutorial 3 on predictive analytics](https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/bads/blob/master/tutorials/3_nb_predictive_analytics.ipynb) \n",
    "Much of the tutorial focused on linear regression. Let's revisit some standard practices in regression analysis. For the fun of it, we will consider another data set. Specifically, we will use a well-known data set associated with wine quality. The data set is available in the *UCI machine learning repository* at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. Spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the data. In a nutshell, wine quality is measured on a scale from 0 (basically toxic) to 10 (heaven in a glass) by means of a survey. Note that the survey used other labels. We take the liberty to describe the data in a more figurative way ;) \n",
    "The data also provides some feature values capturing various (e.g., chemical) characteristics of the wine. The feature  names are fairly self-explanatory. The goal is to understand how the characteristics determine perceived quality (i.e, the target variable. Strictly speaking, the scaling level of the target variable is ordinal and not numeric. However, for simplicity, we consider our task to be a regression task and use linear regression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Loading the data \n",
    "Load and take a look into the data. Print out the number of observations and examine descriptive statistics. Do you see any specific patters? Besides analyzing features individually by calculating descriptive statistics, also pay attention to the correlation between features and the target variable. Depending how advanced you are in your studies, can could also make use of some of the topics that we cover in [Tutorial 4 on data preparation](https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/bads/blob/master/tutorials/4_nb_data_preparation.ipynb).
