        "So, we've gone through some basic feature pre-processing but that was just the tip of the iceberg. Now we'll introduce feature engineering which is the art of creating meaningful features from your processed data. You will likely have to use a combination of domain and statistical knowledge to get the most out of your variables. This includes techniques such as scaling and [transforming](https://machinelearningmastery.com/power-transforms-with-scikit-learn/) (there are [other techniques](https://machinelearningmastery.com/power-transforms-with-scikit-learn/) when dealing with time series data). It could also be the creation of new variables using some kind of combination of the variables that you have.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will discuss basic transformations for feature engineering and how to perform feature selection. As you know, your model should include only include all relevant variables. Any variables which don't help with predictability may cause overfitting and hamper model performance on new data. \n",

        "\n",
        "These values will have a big impact on how Python runs and how models are calculated. When it comes to NaN values and outliers, there are several approaches to deal with them. You could remove them, replace them with another value (indicator value, mode, mean, max, min, etc), use a mini-model to impute them among other options. This has been done for the most part in this data set already. \n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Encode variables in the most appropriate way**\n",
        "\n",
        "Check your dataframe using the method `.info()` . Are your continuous variables encoded as integers or floats? If they are type `object` then the column may need to be checked again for null values. It is good practice to change any categorical variables to the `category` data type as it increases processing time. Once you have confirmed that you will finalize the model with a categorical variable, it can be good to use one-hot encoding as described in step 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3) Ensure variables fit statistical assumptions/model requirements**\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps are a bit more complex and will depend on which model you need to use. Your goal is to make sure your data will be accurately processed by your model. Note that a lot of statistical assumptions depend on normal distribution and scaling. For example, models like linear regression and K-Means are very sensitive to abitrarily large magnitudes. We will first examine ways to do that.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this step, you may also want to remove features which are highly correlated to one another.\n",

        "\n",
        "**5) One-hot encode categorical variables**\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you have decided to keep a categorical feature, it can be useful to one-hot encode the feature. Again, one-hot encoding means that instead of one categorical column, you have multiple dummies which represent possible category values. For example, if your categorical variable \"transport\" had the possible values of \"car\", \"by foot\" or \"bus\", you would split it into columns called \"transport_car\" and \"transport_bus\". \"by foot\" is indicated if neither of those have a value of 1 for that observation.\n",

For many algorithms, like the distance function in kMeans, this is problematic. The distance function will try to minimize differences among features using their raw values. This means that kMeans will focus on variables with arbitrarily high values like spending when that may not be as important as a dummy. One way to deal with this is to scale features so that they still vary but the values aren't arbitrarily higher. This way, all features will be considered equally. \r\n",

        "Normality is a critical condition for many statistical tests and the creation of confidence intervals. If this is the goal of your work, you will likely need to find some way to normalize your variables. Note that normalization does make interpreting your variables more difficult, so if you are not going to be performing statistical tests or creating confidence intervals, it may not be the best option. Here we will introduce 3 very useful tricks: log, Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations.\r\n",

Remember that you are looking for a perfect bell shape with even tails on either side. As you can imagine, this does not happen very often with many variables."

        "Weight of evidence encoding or WoE can be used to check if a variable has predictive power and can replace categories with that predictive power. Let's say we are computing a binary classification problem and we want to use this method to encode a categorical variable. We would first take the percent chance of y=0 (Good) and y=1 (Bad) for each category. Bad and good are often used because WoE comes from the credit scoring industry. We will then divide these two percents and take their natural logarithm. This is the WoE for that particular category, represented mathematically below:\n",

For example, if you had income as a continuous variable, you can determine cut-offs for \"low earners\", \"medium earners\" and \"high earners\" or whatever split makes most sense for your case. You could also use an algorithm find the best split for you (we introduce one below).\n",

        "When you do your regression, you will now replace each bin or category with its respective WoE and perform the regression. The benefits of this include the ability to combine bins with similar WoE values and create more monotonic relationships which are easy to model. The drawbacks are possible loss of information and lack of ability to findd correlation between variables.\n",

        "### Information Value\n",
        "After calculating WoE, we can then calculate information value (IV) for a feature. This value will help us understand if the variable is useful in our prediction at all.

        "#### Object Creation\r\n",
        "Instead of creating multiple functions and putting them together as we have done in the past, we are instead going to do something that is much more common in Python. We will create a new class and new methods/attributes. Note that each class starts with `class` then a name. You will then have to use `__init__` by convention to describe the initial arguments for the class. Note that `self` is always the first argument of everything in a class. This means that the originally set arguments will always be referenced after the object's initial creation. We recommend trying to create an object on your own to gain a much better understanding of how classes, methods and attributes work."

Implement a custom function that receives a feature as input and grid-searches the best value of $\\lambda$. The caller should be able to specify whether s/he wants to use BC or YJ. Your function can assess the merit of a value of $\\lambda$ by means of the function `normaltest()`, the use of which we illustrated above. The more normal a feature after the transformation, the better the value of $\\lambda$. \n",

Note that using the raw feature without transformation is also possible and might be the best approach. Also remember to tune $\\lambda$ when needed using your solution to the previous exercise. Try out your function using the HMEQ data. Display the best transformation for each feature.\n",

        "- Till here, we have assessed the merit of a transformation by means of checking normality using `normaltest()`. Arguably, a better approach for predictive modeling would be to test if a model trained on the transformed data generates better predictions. To implement this logic, you need a custom function that implements our standard predictive modeling pipeline (see, e.g., Tutorial 5 or Tutorial 7) to estimates the predictive performance of a model, say logistic regression, on an input data set. Once you have this function, you can revise your solutions to the previous exercises such that they call the function just implemented instead of `normaltest()`. \n",

Understanding the role of the search criterion is a very good learning outcome in its own right. There is probably no single correct or best solution how to score candidate features.
