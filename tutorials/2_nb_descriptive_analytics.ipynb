        "The third lecture has offered an overview of the field of descriptive analytics. Out of the space of methods for descriptive analytics, the lecture concentrated on techniques for cluster analysis. Given this focus in the lecture, the tutorial will revisit the **kMeans** algorithm and deepen our understanding how this algorithm segments a given data set. This will also help us to introduce some more Python functionality and further develop our understanding of Python programming and relevant libraries. \n",

        "\n",
        "Cluster analysis is a good example of unsupervised machine learning or machine learning with unlabelled data (no specified target variable). Algorithms in this type of analysis attempt to group observations based on their similarities in features. In the end, we can try to describe clusters and how they differ from one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of this application could be analysing data from a survey. We may have several distinct groups of potential buyers who reveal distinct preferences through their choices. Cluster analysis can be applied based on their choices to group similar responses and we can then charaterise groups to determine marketing efforts."

        "\n",
        "kMeans belongs to the family of non-hierarchical cluster analysis methods. Random centroids are spread through the data, then the nearest points to that centroid are assigned to it. The centroids are recalculated based on the new assignment and the observations are reassigned to the nearest point. This process repeats itself until it is stable. Results may differ based on the initial random selection of centroids, so it is important to run this process multiple times and calculate the iteration which results in the smallest distance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms is the way clusters are calculated. While hierarchical clustering often creates sequential splits which maximize homogeneity within final clusters, non-hierarchical clustering with kMeans places random centroids around the feature space and assigns observations to those centroids. In this way, we cannot draw any sort of sequential splits in kMeans."

This means that the function's clusters may not conform to our previous expectation of how splits should occur as it may focus on features which are actually irrelevant or classes may not be distinct enough. Let's see if our results split on the y=1,0 groups or if the algorithm seems to have split the observations in a different way."
