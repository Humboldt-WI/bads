# Exercises
Welcome to the BADS excercise space. The Jupyter notebooks in this folder provide specific programming tasks to challange your programming and data science skills. You are welcome to use the notebooks to advance your coding skills. Occasionally, we might discuss some tasks and their solutions in the BADS excersise sessions. However, the main purpose of these notebooks is to provide you with exemplary tasks for **self-study**. You are welcome to ask questions on the tasks and to discuss your solutions in the BADS Q&A session.
