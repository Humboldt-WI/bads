Libraries like `NumPy` and `Pandas`, which offer a ton of functionality for handling and analyzing data, are the main reason why the Python language is such a good fit for data science.

Say you want to plot the bell curve for $x \\in \\{-3, 3\\} $. Use the `NumPy` function `linspace()` for this purpose. "
