That tutorial was rather comprehensive and provided a lot of materials and codes associated with typical tasks in the wide scope of data preparation.

You can obtain the data, called *loan_data* from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Humboldt-WI/bads/tree/master/data). The data folder of the repository also provides a file *loan_data_dictionary*, which offers a brief description of the features in this data set. In a nutshell, the data represents yet another vanilla credit scoring task with a binary target variable, indicating whether bank customers repaid their debt or defaulted, and a few features characterizing credit applicants. Your first task is to load the data into a `Pandas DataFrame`."

    "The advantage of merging category levels is that we need less dummy variables for encoding the feature. On the other hand, by reducing category levels, we run the risk of losing information. It would make sense to check that our previous merging of category levels did not hurt, e.g., was not too aggressive. Why aggressive? Well, imagine you merge all category levels into one level. This would render the feature useless. So there is a trade-off between having few levels, to not increase dimensionality, and not having too few levels, to sustain the information in the feature for distinguishing good and bad applicants. To find a healthy balance between these conflicting objectives, we need a measure that tells us whether a grouping is informative. It turns out that a well-known statistical test, namely the $\\chi^2$ test, provides this functionality. \n",

    "*HINT:* When merging categories, you should expect $\\chi^2$ test statistic to decrease unless the merged categories have exactly the same odds ratio. When deciding how many (and which) categories to merge, we should balance two conflicting objectives and try reducing the number of categories such that not too much information is lost. When fixing the number of categories, you can use the $\\chi^2$ test to compare competing encodings to select the one that preserves the most information. Play around with different ways to merge categories and try to select the one that achieves a good balance."
