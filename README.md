# Business analytics and data science
Welcome to the business analytics and data science -- BADS -- repository ...

BADS is a master-level lecture offered by members of the [Chair of Information Systems of the Humboldt-University of Berlin](https://www.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/en/Professorships/bwl/wi/standardseite-en?set_language=en). 

Data is omnipresent. Often called “the new oil” to emphasize its value for economy, the data gathered by a business organization is an asset that, if properly cultivated, facilitates improving operations, decision-making, and, by extension, gaining a competitive advantage. Data science is an interdisciplinary field concerned with turning data into insight, actions, and utility. The boundaries between business analytics and data science are not clear cut. We understand data science as a concept emphasizing methodology and business analytics as a concept emphasizing applications of similar methodologies in business. BADS strives to achieve a healthy balance between both, methods and applications. More specifically, we aim at equiping students with a solid understanding of empirical models for data-driven decision support, the technical expertise to design, estimate, tune, use, and diagnose the corressponding models to judge their adaquacy, and the ability to communicate data- and model-based insights to stakeholders in business organizations. 

Video lectures from past semesters are available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLouxP1LEXV4nqkWpmJno7oHuqK_UgoYHB). This repository provides demo codes, tutorials, exercises, and solutions that accompany the lecture. The programming language used for BADS will be Python.

This repository is under development and will continuously be populated with content over the course of the winter semester 2022/2023.
