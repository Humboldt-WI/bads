    "# Regularization\n",
    "Regularization is a technique to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In the context of the *bias-variance trade-off*, you can think of regularization as a way to introduce bias to reduce variance and ultimately achieve a better balance between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to implement this idea? The answer depends on the type of learning algorithm. For regression-type models the answer is: add a complexity penalty to the loss. Large values of the regression coefficients are indicators of complex, unstable models. Possible causes include high dimensionality and multicollinearity. The regularized loss function as the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min\\limits_{\\beta} ⁡\\mathcal{L} (\\beta)+\\lambda|(\\beta)| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This penalty produces sparser models as it forces the coefficients to zero. Furthermore, we also have a new hyperparameter $\\lambda$, which governs the strength of regularization. Simply put, $\\lambda$ embodies our preference for models that fit the training data more accurately (low $\\lambda$) or models that are less complex (high $\\lambda$). It is difficult to know suitable settings of $\\lambda$ a priori. Thus, we typically tune this *hyperparameter* for each data set. We will get to hyperparamater tuning later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed common forms of regularization. Let's revisit those in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lasso or L1 Regularization\n",
    "The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator or LASSO set the penalty to equal to the sum of the absolute coefficients multiplied by some *shrinkage* value, denoted by $\\lambda$. The LASSO optimization problem can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\arg\\min_{\\beta_j} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\sum_{j}x_{ij} \\beta_j)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j | $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is **crucial to standardize numerical features when using Lasso**. Standardization is crucial to ensure that every feature, independent of the magnitude of common feature values (e.g., several thousands for a feature *salary* as opposed to small int value for a feature *years of education*) has the same chances of *surviving* lasso regularization. Here, survive means receiving a non-zero coefficient. Intuitively, shrinking the coefficient of a feature with large values (e.g., salary) will reduce the penalty more than shrinking the coefficient of a feature with smaller feature values (e.g., years of education). Lasso performs **embedded feature selection** meaning that it is likely to set some coefficients to zero, which is equivalent to discarding the feature. If two or more variables are highly correlated, lasso will arbitrarily select one of them and assign a non-zero coefficient, while the other correlated features are likely to receive a coefficient value of zero. This behavior is sometimes desirable, for example to remove *redundant features* but also cause problems, for example if the features are dummy codes originating from the same categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ridge or L2 Regularization\n",
    "Ridge regression is similar to lasso regression with the difference of the penalty being equal to the sum of the **square of the coefficients** multipled by some shrinkage value. Here is the objective function for L2 regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\arg\\min_{\\beta_j} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\sum_{j}x_{ij} \\beta_j)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j^2 | $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it is crucial to **standardize all continuous variables** before performing ridge regression. The reason is the same as for Lasso. Ridge regression never really sets coefficient values to zero due to the square. So, if all parameters are believed to hold some importance, it may be better to use this method of regularization. Note that ridge regression only works if the number of coefficients is less than the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Elastic Net\n",
    "Elastic Net (enet) is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It is best used when an analyst is unsure whether ridge or lasso is more suitable for a given data set. The enet penalty specifies two separate shrinkage values. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\arg\\min_{\\beta_j} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\sum_{j}x_{ij} \\beta_j)^2 + \\lambda_1 \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j | + \\lambda_2 \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j^2 | $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the bigger disadvantages of enet is the computational cost required to find the best combination of the two shrinkage values. It is also important to check if lasso alone might have done a better job at preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working examples of regularized logistic regression\n",
    "The *sklearn* implementation of logistic regression supports L1, L2, and elastic net regularization. The relevant class is `LogisticRegression` from the module `sklearn.linear_model`. The type of regularization is specified via the parameter `penalty`, which can take the values `'l1'`, `'l2'`, and `'elasticnet'`. The strength of regularization is controlled by the parameter `C`, which is the inverse of the shrinkage value $\\lambda$. Thus, smaller values of `C` imply stronger regularization. When using elastic net regularization, you also need to specify the parameter `l1_ratio`, which controls the relative weight of L1 and L2 regularization. A value of `l1_ratio=0` implies pure L2 regularization, while a value of `l1_ratio=1` implies pure L1 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we train and evaluate a logistic regression model with L2 regularization on our HMEQ data, and compare the result to the baseline model, our logistic regression model `lr`, which was trained without was adding a regularization penalty to the loss function (see, [Preliminaries](#Preliminaries)). Note that not all solvers that *sklearn* offers for logistic regression support all types of regularization. For L1 regularization, we use the solver `'saga'`, which supports both L1 and elastic net regularization."

Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set before training.
