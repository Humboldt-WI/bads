    "Our data set, called the  \"Home Equity\" or, in brief, HMEQ data set, is provided by [Credit Risk Analytics.Net](http://www.creditriskanalytics.net). It comprises  information about a set of borrowers, which are categorized along demographic variables and variables concerning their business relationship with the lender. A binary target variable called 'BAD' is  provided and indicates whether a borrower has repaid her/his debt. You can think of the data as a standard use case of binary classification. Specifically, the data set consists of 5,960 observations and 13 features including a binary target variable. The variables are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BAD: the target variable, 1=default; 0=non-default \n",
    "- LOAN: amount of the loan request\n",
    "- MORTDUE: amount due on an existing mortgage\n",
    "- VALUE: value of current property\n",
    "- REASON: DebtCon=debt consolidation; HomeImp=home improvement\n",
    "- JOB: occupational categories\n",
    "- YOJ: years at present job\n",
    "- DEROG: number of major derogatory reports\n",
    "- DELINQ: number of delinquent credit lines\n",
    "- CLAGE: age of oldest credit line in months\n",
    "- NINQ: number of recent credit inquiries\n",
    "- CLNO: number of credit lines\n",
    "- DEBTINC: debt-to-income ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The features describe the financial situation of a borrower. We will keep using the data set for many tutorials and tasks. So it makes sense to familiarize yourself with the features. Make sure you understand what type of information they provide and what this information might reveal about the risk of defaulting.  "

There are multiple ways to do so. One common approach involves computing a *fence* of plausible values and declaring values outside this *fence* as outliers. This is the essence of Tuky's rule, defining upper and lower fences as 1.5 (or 3) times the inter-quartile range (IQR) above the 75th percentile and below the 25th percentile, respectively. Values outside these fences are considered outliers. Let us first illustrate this idea for one feature `LOAN`."
