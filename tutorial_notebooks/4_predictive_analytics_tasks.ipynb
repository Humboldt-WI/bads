    "# Tutorial 4 - Foundations of predictive analytics\n",
    "The lecture has introduced the standard data structure for predictive analytics. We need data with input variables and a **target variable**. The goal of predictive analytics is to derive a functional relationship between the input variables and the target. We assume that we can observe, measure, or control the input variables. Hence, our predictive model (the functional relationship between inputs and the target that we infer from past data), facilitates forecasting the expected value of the target variable based on the input variables. Whenever we observe a new case, we gather the values of the input variables for that case and feed them into our prediction model. Receiving that input, the model will produce a forecast of the target variable value for that case. So, predictive analytics is all about finding *good* **input-to-output mappings**.\n",

    "## Our first predictive model: linear regression\n",
    "Linear regression assumes a linear additive relationship between features and the target. Specifically, we assume a model:\n",
    "$$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 +  \\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \\beta_m x_m + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "where $y$ is the target variable, $\\beta$ denotes the regression coefficients (as usual), $x_j, j=1, ..., d$ are our features, and $\\epsilon$ denotes the error term. Adopting the above perspective, when using linear regression, we assume we *know* the true functional form of the input-to-output mapping. Specifically, we assume this mapping to be linear and additive. Under this assumption, our task is to find the unknown parameters that characterize our mapping function, and these are the regression coefficients $\\beta$. "
