    "## Cell Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of cells in a Jupyter notebooks and many other Python editing platforms. These are text cells (more formally called markdown cells) and code cells. Text cells (like this one) are to explain the context of the code or a data science concept and walk readers through logic or background information. Text cells support basic formatting including **bolding**, _italics_, ```code snippits``` but also  lists, indented text and more (see, e.g., [https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Code can then be run sequentially as readers review the notebook and go through the text cells. Outputs of these cells can be saved too so they do not have to be run again. However, if the local machine didn't just run the code and there are no saved values for it to load, the results may need to be run the full way through again to be replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the cell content with 'm' for markup and 'y' for code. Remember that you need to be in selection (or command) mode.\n"

    "## Editing Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells have multiple modes. When the cell marker is blue, you can select cells with the keyboard arrows and handle them by creating new cells, moving, copying or deleting them. When you press 'Enter' while selecting a cell, you jump into editing mode and can change the content of a cell, e.g. by writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of actions you can perform are listed under Help > Keyboard shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   New cells are inserted with a (above) or b (below)\n",
    "*   Cells can be c copied, x cut and v pasted\n",
    "*   Cells are deleted by pressing d two times\n",
    "*   To run a cell and select the next cell: Shift + Enter\n",
    "*   While typing, use Tab to finish the object name for you and Shift + Tab to see the documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth remembering the shortcuts to work efficiently. There are other commands like having your code start with '!' so Python runs the command in command prompt or '%' which indicates that the next function's argument will be the entire line (similarly, '%%' means the function's argument is the entire cell). More about functions will come up shortly.\n",

If you'd like it to produce multiple at once, it can be useful to use the print command as shown at the end. Python will explicitly print all outputs in any print command (even if there are multiple).\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding the character '#', you are telling Python to ignore the following characters on the same line. This is called creating a **comment** and can be very useful to explain your code to others."

    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented language. Every element of code that you encounter is called an 'object'. Each 'object' has a 'class' or 'type'. The class or type of an object dictates how it can interact with other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object Oriented Programming (OOP), there is generally a difference between class and type. However, since Python 3, these ideas have been merged. Traditionally, types are built-in with the original program. Primitive types are the most basic objects built in the program, like string or integer. Classes are created by users for different functions. So you can create a class, but you cannot create a type. Each time you create an object, it is called an **instance** of that class/type.\n",
    "\n",
    " **However, as mentioned, now the idea of class and type have been merged in Python 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data type/class has its own methods and attributes attached to it. It is very useful to get to know these as they encompass common tasks which may otherwise require you to import functions which are not actually necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are functions specific to the class/type of your object. **They will always use your object as its first argument, since this is done automatically by calling a method, you do not have to write this explicitly**. They can sometimes take additional arguments as well. Check the documentation of the object to see what other method arguments exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format to call one of your object's methods is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object_name.method(possible_arguments_if_any)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes** are properties of your object which can be displayed. The format to call them is similar but note the absence of parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "object_name.attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attributes are more common in more advanced data types. In the final section for today, we will see some with NumPy arrays.\n",
